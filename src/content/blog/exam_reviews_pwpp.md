## Overview

This post is a quick review of the Practical Web Pentest Professional (PWPP) exam. 
[TCM Security - PWPP Certification](https://certifications.tcm-sec.com/pwpp/?ref=pir4cy.com)

Similar to other TCM exams that I have attempted in the past, TCM provides a clear overview of the certification process:
>The Practical Web Pentest Professional (PWPP) certification is a professional-level penetration testing exam experience. This exam will assess a student’s ability to perform a web application penetration test by requiring them to exploit more advanced vulnerabilities including NoSQL, race conditions, mass assignment, SSRF, template injection, and more.
> Students will have **three** **(3) full days** to complete the assessment and an additional **two (2) days** to write a professional report.
>The PWPP is a challenging exam that simulates a real-world web application penetration testing experience. In order to receive the certification, a student must:
>-	Exploit a web application using any preferred tools or techniques.
>-  Provide a detailed, professionally written report.

## Why take the exam? 
Despite spending time learning how to pwn boxes in HackTheBox or TryHackMe, I felt like web and API testing is not my strong suit. 
I (re)started my web journey with the PWPA - revising all the basics and improving my skillset along the way. 

With the PWPA under my belt, I wanted to continue my journey and improve upon the existing skillset I gained from that experience.

## Study Material
A purchase of the exam voucher comes with 12 month access to the following courses: 

- [Practical API Hacking](https://academy.tcm-sec.com/p/hacking-apis/?ref=pir4cy.com)
- [Practical Web Hacking](https://academy.tcm-sec.com/p/practical-web-hacking/?ref=pir4cy.com) 

TCM recommends completing both courses before attempting the exam to ensure a successful attempt. Both courses are led by instructor Alex Olsen, who was also an instructor for the PWPA study material. 

Both courses are a step up from the PWPA and assume a basic understanding of the core principles taught in the Bug Bounty course. The courses complement each other and help you create a methodology for web application pentesting in general, covering advanced attacks. Alex does a fantastic job in covering all the topics along with the challenges within the course.

I would like to emphasize the importance of taking notes as you go through the course as these will come in handy during the exam. 

One of the best parts about these courses are the challenges you get throughout the course to apply what you have learned.

The course also covers some labs from Portswigger's Web Academy, which is a great resource to learn more about the attacks covered in the study material. To maximize my chances, I used Web Academy as supplemental material as well.
## The Exam

### Assessment
>TL;DR - The exam is another fun experience to go through. Although it was harder than the PWPA. It allows you to apply everything you have learned during the study material. 

The exam offers 3 full days to perform the assessment and from my experience, 72 hours is enough time to complete the exam. As stated in the exam description, you are expected to perform a web application pentest with any set of tools and techniques. 
The exam itself was fair and challenging. It is not limited to generic spray and pray exploits and will force you to think about the application you are testing. Treating the exam like a real web application assessment will take you a long way in achieving success. 

As I have come to expect from TCM exams, the environment was stable and did not cause any issues despite my rigorous testing. 

### Report
After the 3 days of the assessment, you have 2 days to create a report. However, depending on how you take your notes, the report can be quicker. 
I completed the report in about 2 hours right at the end of my exam. If you have never written these reports before, make sure to allocate enough time for report writing. 
A template is also provided to help you in creating your report. It is not mandatory to use the template, but it certainly helps in getting an idea of what is expected from your report. As long as it is clear and professional, you should be good!

I submitted the report and received a notification of passing the very next morning. The TCM team is quick to assess and inform you of the status of your exam. 

## Final Thoughts
- As expected from TCM, their courses were great and taught me a lot about web testing. 
- The exam in itself was unique and challenging. It was a rewarding experience and solidified my methodology further.
- I am definitely interested in the next level of web testing - [Practical Web Pentest Expert](https://certifications.tcm-sec.com/pwpe/?ref=pir4cy.com)
